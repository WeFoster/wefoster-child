# Build Better Communities

To help you get started quickly weâ€™ve created a pre-made Child Theme that has some inline documentation and pre-made folder structures. 

This allows you to learn as you go and develop your child themes the same way as we do for our clients. We strongly recommend you to use this as a starting point.

## Documentation

You can find all our documentation on https://documentation.wefoster.co.
